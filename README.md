## About

This program takes images of cards and generates a PDF file containing multiple card images lined up in rows and collumns. Generated PDF's can be printed and cut in order to make a custom deck of cards.

## Implementation

This project is written in the Python programming language due to the strong graphics libraries and for the sake of time.

## Dependencies

This program relies on the Python library `pillow`.

How to install `pillow` using `pip` according to their [documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#basic-installation).

The program also expects a directory named "Cards" to be placed in the same directory containing the program. The "Cars" folder should contain images of the cards that you intend to use.
